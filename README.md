# The_Hangman_Game

Hangman is a simple game where one can verify his knowledge of European Capitals (but also other continents if a Player wishes so...).
Game was created in C# as a recruitment task for the Motorola Academy program.

## About Me

Some time ago I decided to step out of the finance outsourcing world, and  become a (self-taught) software developer.
I started learning Java (maybe because it sounded nice), but it could be any other language.
Finally I feel I am ready to start my career in the IT industry  to match what I already know with practical working experience.

## Why Software Development

1. Lack of dress-code.
2. It is like solving brain puzzle games or math tasks - all the boxes need to fit and be correctly connected.
3. When you are aware of it, you can see it (software) is everywhere around and I want to be a part of it.
4. It is like constant training which you do not get tired with, and which you can practice and use very quickly.
5. I am convinced this is the place for me.
6. ... and many more ...

## Why C# at Motorola Academy

I started to learn software development with Java and I was not planning to switch to another language (before getting some proficiency with the first one).
However there are not many job opportunities for 40 years olds without an IT degree nor standard 2 years experience, so when a friend from Motorola told me about this program, I  applied.
Turned out switching from Java to C# in 4 days was a very nice experience.

## About Hangman task

I decided to add an option to select other continents' capitals (as data was already in the file), but as specified, the initial game is related to Europe only.
I am aware my code is far from SOLID - this is one of educational gaps I still need to close - but I am sure this will come with experience.
I hope I have not done many obvious C# errors - as stated I switched to it 4 days ago.
